# Monis Xtreme

A crazy falling-blocks minigame collection.


## Run

Install PyGame: `http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml`

Then: `./run.sh`


## Controls

Monis Xtreme uses only the mouse. You mouse must have both left/right buttons and a scroll wheel.
Trying to close the window will take you out of whatever you're currently doing.


## Playing Monis

At its core, Monis Xtreme is a falling blocks game.
Blocks will fall from the top of the screen. If they fill up the screen, it's game over.
Get 5 blocks of the same color together, and they explode, netting you points.
There are three phases, indicated by a clock in the bottom-right.

* Phase 1: Click left and right to move blocks that are currently falling.
* Phase 2: Hover over a row and click left and right to cycle the row.
* Phase 3: Hover over a column and scroll up and down to cycle the column.

You might want to try out 'Training Mode' first.


## Minigames

Occasionally, between rounds, you'll get to play a minigame.
Figure out for yourself what to do!


## Items

By destroying blocks and winning minigames, you fill up your item bar (in the top-right corner).
When it's full enough, you can purchase items.
The top three destroy blocks.
`+10` increases your score, and the star makes you only need groups of 4 blocks instead of 5.
Some of these destroy blocks, others give you points or increase your combo.


## Do not be afraid

Some strange stuff can happen in this game. Just ignore it and keep on truckin'.
